\chapter{Literature Survey}\label{ch:literature-survey}

In late September 2022, the famed OpenAI research laboratory (known for their `GPT-3' language
model) released a new open-source ASR system known as `Whisper'~\cite{whisper}.
Whisper is unique in being very large (trained on 680,000 hours of speech data), open-source, and
fully supervised;
meaning all the training data used to create the model has been accurately checked by humans.

\section{Data Collection}\label{sec:data-collection}

The key requirement for comparing these systems is a large dataset of speech recordings over a
wide range of ages, with labels denoting the age of the speaker and an accurate transcript to
compare ASR performance against.
There is a surprising lack of relevant resources online, with most speech corpora featuring
labeled speaker age not featuring a diverse age range.

The LifeLUCID Corpus is, however, collected with the express purpose of providing a wide range of
speaker age~\cite{lifelucid}.
This resource has great potential in providing an insight into the age-variable performance of
ASR because it features 104 British English speakers between 8 and 85 years of age.

It is of interest to observe any patterns in errors made by each system, especially if there are
any similarities in where they lose accuracy.
Once the areas of error are understood, comparing and contrasting audio spectra may allow for
insight into which features of speech create problems for ASR .
