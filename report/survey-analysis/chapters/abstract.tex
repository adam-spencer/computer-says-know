\chapter*{\Large \center Abstract}

Progress to create highly-accurate Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) technology has been rapid
in recent years, catalysed by huge collections of speech data.
The issue is, people over the age of 60's speech is processed with notably higher inaccuracy
than other age groups, and they lack representation in speech datasets.

The aim of this work is to analyse the literature regarding aging voices, present ASR and
provide a look at the state-of-the-art, demonstrate how ASR accuracy is lacking for elderly
people, and begin to develop an understanding of methods to reduce this accuracy imbalance.

The project has begun experimentation with existing ASR systems using high performance
computing clusters and started gathering speech data, aiming to perform further experiments to
analyse potential methods to improve such systems.
