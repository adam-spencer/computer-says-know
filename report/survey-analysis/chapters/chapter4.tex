\chapter{Progress}\label{ch:progress}

To this date, the progress on this work is as follows;

\begin{itemize}
    \item Access has been granted for this project to utilise Sheffield's High Performance
    Computing (HPC) `Bessemer' cluster, enabling ASR models to be run over entire speech corpora.
    \item Whisper\cite{whisper} has been installed on Bessemer and tested using the pre-trained
    `large-v2' model.
    \item The Switchboard I (LDC97S62)\cite{switchboard-ldc} and MACROPHONE
    \item (LDC94S21)\cite{macrophone} corpora have been added to Bessemer as they were found to
    contain reasonably diverse age ranges and are readily available via the LDC\@.
    \item For the purposes of this project, access has been granted to the LifeLUCID
    corpus~\cite{lifelucid} by the rights owner.
    \item Whisper has been used to successfully transcribe part of the MACROPHONE corpus with the
    purpose of gaining an understanding of the way metadata is stored in LDC corpora, providing an
    approximation of Whisper's runtime, and exploring the HPC system's functionality.
\end{itemize}
