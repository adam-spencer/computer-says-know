\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

Automatic Speech Recognition systems are rapidly increasing in accuracy, from 17.1\% word error
rate (WER) in 2011~\cite{seide2011} to 5.1\% in 2021~\cite{Ng2021} on the same Switchboard
corpus~\cite{switchboard}.
Though this increase in accuracy is promising for the average English speaker, elderly speakers
have different speech patterns~\cite{Horton2010} and are transcribed less accurately than other age
groups~\cite{picone1990}.

\\
The objective of this work is to provide an in-depth understanding of how the differences
between elderly and non-elderly speech influence the accuracy of different types of ASR systems,
and which (if any) current models best fit the task of transcribing elderly speech.
