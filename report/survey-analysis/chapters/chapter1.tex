\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

Automatic Speech Recognition systems are rapidly increasing in accuracy, from 17.1\% word error
rate (WER) in 2011~\cite{seide2011} to 5.1\% in 2021~\cite{Ng2021} on the same Switchboard
corpus~\cite{switchboard}.
Though this increase in accuracy is promising for the average English speaker, elderly speakers
have different speech patterns~\cite{Horton2010} and are transcribed less accurately than other age
groups~\cite{picone1990}.\\

ASR systems' performance is evaluated using huge datasets of pre-transcribed speech, called
speech corpora, which contain metadata regarding the demographic of the speakers.
Existing, commonly used datasets~\cite{librispeech, switchboard} often contain very few samples
from people over the age of 60, meaning even if a state-of-the-art system is shown to be more
accurate than a human transcriber~\cite{chung2021} on a specific dataset, their performance can
be very poor when processing elderly speech.\\

This work aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the differences between elderly and
non-elderly speech and how these differences influence the accuracy of ASR systems.
It will also explore current research to inform the ways through which improvements to ASR systems'
ability to process elderly speakers could be realised.

\section{Overview of the Report}\label{sec:overview-of-the-report}

This is a preliminary report aiming to provide an overview of relevant literature an detail the
aims of the project, including progress on the project so far.
Excluding the introduction, the report is split into three chapters as follows;

\begin{itemize}
    \item A literature survey which provides an understanding of the field of ASR, the problems
    faced by ASR when processing elderly speech, and existing ASR research which has informed the
    trajectory of the project;
    followed by
    \item A distillation of the requirements of the project as informed by the literature;
    and finally
    \item A summary of the progress completed to this date, conclusions formed thus far, and the
    plan for the remainder of the project.
\end{itemize}
