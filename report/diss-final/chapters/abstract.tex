Can a computer know if someone said 'know' or 'no'?

If automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems could estimate where they were likely to have gone wrong, such a system could be used to aid a human transcriber by presenting them with the results it is less confident of and allowing them to work through the results until the errors are sparse.

This work explores the possibility of using a new ASR system by OpenAI called \emph{Whisper} to reduce the amount of speech data which must be manually transcribed, finding a metric of confidence which can halve the number of ASR transcript errors while checking 44\% fewer results than if they were unaided.
