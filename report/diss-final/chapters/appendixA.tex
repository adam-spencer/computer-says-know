\chapter{Example of the TextGrid Format}

This example serves to illustrate the lack of readability of a TextGrid file.
To aid formatting, it is displayed in two columns, though the original file is a long series of \emph{intervals}.

It represents a piece of audio which is under three seconds in length (from a 10 minute-long recording) and consists of the text \say{a bush with a yellow duck on top}.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{verbatim}
intervals [12]:
  xmin = 20.899 
  xmax = 20.971783458461772 
  text = "SIL" 
intervals [13]:
  xmin = 20.971783458461772 
  xmax = 21.05 
  text = "a" 
intervals [14]:
  xmin = 21.05 
  xmax = 21.47 
  text = "BUSH" 
intervals [15]:
  xmin = 21.47 
  xmax = 21.66 
  text = "with" 
intervals [16]:
  xmin = 21.66 
  xmax = 21.720024609817834 
  text = "A" 
intervals [17]:
  xmin = 21.720024609817834 
  xmax = 22.1 
  text = "SIL" 
intervals [18]:
  xmin = 22.1 
  xmax = 22.49 
  text = "yellow" 
intervals [19]:
  xmin = 22.49 
  xmax = 22.84 
  text = "duck" 
intervals [20]:
  xmin = 22.84 
  xmax = 23.06 
  text = "ON" 
intervals [21]:
  xmin = 23.06 
  xmax = 23.769 
  text = "top"
