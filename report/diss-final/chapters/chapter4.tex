\section{Speech Data}

The original aim of this work was to explore the impact of age-related changes to speech on ASR performance.
Despite the scope of the project having since changed, the data gathered fits the new objective very well.

This aforementioned data is the \emph{LifeLUCID} Corpus\cite{lifelucid}.
It consists of 52 recordings of conversations between 104 discrete speakers aged between 8 and 85 years old.
They are solving a 'spot-the-difference' task, and the data selected for this work was recorded in normal conditions (that is, they can hear and communicate with eachother normally).

The reference transcripts were generated by an ASR system and only one channel's audio was human-corrected.
The ability to compare the quality of ASR output to a reference transcript is required to evaluate this work, thus, only the human-corrected transcript and corresponding audio channel were used to ensure the references are reliable.
This leaves 52 10-minute recordings of individual speakers with gaps where the other participant is speaking.

\subsection{TextGrid Format}

The reference transcripts are supplied in \emph{Praat TextGrid} format which is produced by the Praat software suite\cite{praat}.
The TextGrid format consists of each individual part of speech (words, hesitations, mid-sentence silences, silences when the other participant is speaking etc.) being present in consecutive entries with the time in the recording which they start and finish.

This is an example of a single word in TextGrid format;

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\begin{BVerbatim}
intervals [14]:
  xmin = 21.05 
  xmax = 21.47 
  text = "BUSH" 
\end{BVerbatim}
\end{figure}

A full example of this format is available in Appendix \ref{appendix:textgrid}.

As shown by this example, \texttt{xmin} and \texttt{xmax} denote the points in the recording at which the section starts and ends, and \texttt{text} denotes the content of the section.
Considering that each entry appears consecutively and that there are over 1,000 in each file, the format is not easily human-readable.

\subsection{Data Preparation}

There are a number of issues with using the data in its original format, including;

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Whisper struggles to maintain alignment when transcribing longform data\cite{whisper}, so the approximate 10-minute length of each recording requires shortening to maintain system performance;
  \item TextGrids are not human-readable; and
  \item The output of the ASR system should be stored alongside the reference transcripts to ease evaluation, which is not possible using TextGrids.
\end{enumerate}

The solution to the first problem would best be solved by splitting the conversation recordings into individual utterances.
Luckily, the human-evaluated references include metadata which shows the start- and stop-times of each word and non-word part of speech, meaning it can easily be split into individual utterances without using voice activation detection or other automatic techniques.

The second and third problems could be solved together by changing from the TextGrid format to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
This format is human-readable\cite{nurseitov2009comparison} and able to hold all the data and metadata required for this work, including a way to reference the original piece of audio it represents.

\mycomment{
  All going well here, just need to write about how utterances are computed
  * Using tokens from documentation (give examples)
  * Along with some thresholds (maxmimum mid-sentence pause length, minimum post-sentence pause length before breaking)
  * Remove all non-speech tokens (including spoken hesitations like 'um')
  * break tokens are <SILP> and <GA>
  * junk tokens are SIL, <BELL> <LG> <BR> and spoken hesitations
