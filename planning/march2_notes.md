# Meeting on March 2

* Log prob may not be a great measure - high score should indicate good performance however
* Look for correlation between human and machine errors- do specific speakers cause more disagreements
* python webrtcvad lib
* To rank transcriptions must do batch transcription
* May be unnecessary to use large model - humans in loop make up for error. if errors are reliably tracked, doesn't need to be quite as highly accurate
* Cut out utterances, allow human to view wider context
* chronological order AND confidence order
* Find some conversational corpora!! has context
* use sox for audio preproccessing
