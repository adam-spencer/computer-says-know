These results were collected using best_of=5 and beam_size=5, as used in the whisper docs.

Model was medium.en

I've yet to read over the results but hope to remember to write something here and conduct some more experiments.

There was something I had read somewhere about using an array of temperature values, using subsequent vals as fallback if the results are likely poor. May be worth a look given most errors (at least in v1) were hallucinations rather than genuine mislabellings.
