## V4 Results

These results are half the same as the V3 results, but I've corrected the other half that had errors.

Turns out, LifeLUCID had two recordings for pair of speakers, though the speakers are switched from 'A' to 'B' between the recordings.

Their recording channels, however, where not!

From what I can tell at this moment, this was the problem throwing my results totally out of the window.
