# Info

This set of data (v5.2-wer-and-prob) was generated using the following command:

```
../src/calculate_wer ./v5.1-norm-no-hesitations/ -o ./v5.2-wer-and-prob
```

I've decided that I'd like to remove the final `average_wer` bit right at the end of the file in order to make input into asr-app.py much easier.
